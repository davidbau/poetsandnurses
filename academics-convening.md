# The Convening Role of Universities

*Building the Coalitions That Economic Leverage Requires*

---

The main obstacle to economic leverage in defense of democracy is coordination. Individual businesses that resist federal overreach face retaliation; individual unions that strike alone absorb all the cost. The solution is collective commitment — but collective commitment requires someone to convene the conversation, build trust across sectors, and create the framework for binding agreements.

Universities are uniquely positioned to play this role.

#### Why Universities Can Convene

**Legitimacy across divides.** Universities have relationships with business (through research partnerships, advisory boards, and alumni networks), with labor (through campus unions and workforce pipelines), and with faith communities (through chaplaincies, divinity schools, and community partnerships). A summit hosted by a university carries different weight than one hosted by a corporation, a union, or a political organization.

**Existing infrastructure.** Universities already convene. They host conferences, policy summits, executive education programs, and cross-sector dialogues. The administrative capacity exists; it needs to be directed toward democratic defense.

**Intellectual resources.** Law schools can provide constitutional analysis. Business schools can model economic scenarios. Policy schools can design coordination mechanisms. Political scientists can advise on strategy. This expertise should be in service of building the coalitions the moment requires.

**Relative insulation.** Tenured faculty have job protections most workers lack. Private universities have endowment cushions. Even public universities have some insulation through accreditation, state funding, and alumni support. This relative security creates an obligation to take risks others cannot.

#### What Universities Should Convene

**1. Regional democracy defense summits**

Bring together, in the same room:
- Local business owners and executives
- Union leadership (both campus and community unions)
- Faith leaders across denominations
- State and local elected officials
- Election administrators
- Legal experts on constitutional crisis scenarios

The goal is not a single meeting but an ongoing structure: relationships built, communication channels established, and contingency plans developed. What happens if the election is contested? What does coordinated economic action look like in this region? Who commits to what, and under what conditions?

**2. Tech leadership dialogues**

Technology companies have enormous economic leverage but no coordination mechanism for democratic defense. Many tech leaders have expressed concern about authoritarianism — but concern without coordination is impotent.

Universities have unique access: through computer science departments, business school advisory boards, research partnerships, and alumni networks. A university-hosted dialogue on "technology leadership and democratic resilience" could bring together people who would not otherwise be in the same room.

The tech angle matters because:
- Tech companies control communication infrastructure that democratic coordination depends on
- Tech market caps represent significant economic leverage
- Tech employment is concentrated in ways that could enable coordinated action
- Many tech leaders want to act but lack a framework

**3. Cross-institutional academic coordination**

Universities should also coordinate with each other. The American Association of Universities (AAU), the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), and discipline-specific organizations provide existing networks.

The question to pose: What are universities collectively prepared to do if constitutional democracy is suspended? (See: [The Winter 2027 Commitment](winter-2027.md))

#### What Faculty Can Do Now

If your university president will not convene, faculty can act:

**Through faculty senates:** Pass resolutions calling on the administration to host regional democracy defense convenings. Make the case publicly that universities have a civic obligation to use their convening power.

**Through departments and schools:** Law schools, business schools, and policy schools can host their own convenings without central administration approval. A "Democracy and Business" symposium at a business school brings executives onto campus. A "Constitutional Crisis Scenarios" workshop at a law school builds legal coordination.

**Through professional associations:** The AAUP, disciplinary associations, and learned societies can coordinate across institutions. A joint statement from the American Political Science Association, the American Bar Association, and the American Economic Association calling for university-hosted convenings would create pressure.

**Through research:** Document what coordination mechanisms have worked historically. Model the economic impact of various collective action scenarios. Provide the intellectual infrastructure that convening requires.

#### What Administrators Can Do Now

**Name the obligation.** University presidents should publicly articulate that democratic defense is part of the university's civic mission — not partisan politics, but defense of the constitutional order that makes academic freedom possible.

**Allocate resources.** Assign staff to organizing convenings. Provide space and logistical support. Fund travel for participants who need it. This is not expensive relative to university budgets, but it requires someone to prioritize it.

**Use existing relationships.** Every university has corporate partners, donor networks, and community relationships. These relationships can be activated for democratic defense. A call from a university president to a CEO carries weight.

**Coordinate with peer institutions.** Don't act alone. Reach out to other presidents. Build the network of institutions willing to play the convening role. Collective action by universities models the collective action you are trying to enable.

#### The Stakes

Universities are being [targeted by this administration](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/targeting-higher-education-is-an-essential-tool-in-the-autocratic-playbook/) precisely because they are bulwarks of democracy. The response cannot be to retreat into institutional self-protection. As [Michael Ignatieff observed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-university-fights-an-authoritarian-regime) from his experience leading Central European University under Orbán: early cooperation with authoritarian demands does not buy safety — it only delays and worsens the eventual confrontation.

The same convening power that makes universities valuable to authoritarians who want to control them makes universities valuable to democratic defense. The question is whether university leaders will use that power, or whether they will wait until it is taken from them.
