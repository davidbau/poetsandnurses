# The Society for AI Safety

*A Pledge for People Who Build AI*

---

Doctors swear an oath: *first, do no harm.* It is a simple promise, but it defines what medicine is. It means that no matter who is paying, no matter what is asked, there are things a doctor will not do.

People who build AI systems need a similar commitment. AI is now powerful enough to kill, to deceive, and to be turned against the people it was supposed to serve. The individuals who build these systems face enormous pressure from employers, governments, and clients. Without a shared standard — something they can point to and say *this is what our profession does not do* — each person faces that pressure alone.

The Society for AI Safety exists to make that standard explicit, shared, and publicly accountable.

## The Pledge

Members of the Society for AI Safety make three commitments:

### 1. Do Not Kill

We will not build AI systems that make lethal decisions autonomously.

Killing is a human act. It carries moral weight and legal consequences that belong to a person, not a machine. An AI system that selects targets, fires weapons, or causes death without a human being consciously and accountably pulling the trigger has removed human judgment from the most irreversible decision there is.

We commit to ensuring that wherever our systems touch questions of life and death, a human being is genuinely in the loop — not as a rubber stamp, but as a responsible moral agent.

### 2. Do Not Deceive

We will not build AI systems that hide what they are.

People have a right to know when they are talking to a machine. An AI that impersonates a human — that denies being an AI when sincerely asked, that manipulates people by pretending to have feelings, relationships, or experiences it does not have — is a tool of deception. It erodes trust in communication itself.

We commit to building systems that are honestly identifiable as AI. When asked, our systems will say what they are. We will not deploy AI in contexts designed to make users believe they are talking to a person.

### 3. Do Not Break the Law

We will not build AI systems that violate the rights of the people they affect.

This means more than following local regulations. Human rights are not gifts from governments; they are protections against governments. The right to speak freely, to privacy from unwarranted surveillance, to equal treatment regardless of who you are — these are recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and encoded in constitutional law around the world.

In the United States, this means we will not build AI that enables the government to abridge freedom of speech, to conduct mass surveillance without legal process, or to discriminate against people on the basis of their beliefs or associations. These are not partisan positions. The Bill of Rights was designed precisely to protect people from powerful actors — including their own government — and AI is now one of the most powerful tools any actor can deploy.

We commit to assessing not just whether our systems are legal in the narrow sense, but whether they respect the rights of the people they affect.

## Why These Three

These are not the only ethical obligations of AI practitioners. They are the ones we treat as absolute — the lines we will not cross regardless of who asks or why.

Most ethical questions in AI involve tradeoffs: privacy versus utility, safety versus capability, individual benefit versus social risk. Reasonable people can disagree. But some things are not tradeoffs. Building a machine to kill without human accountability is not a tradeoff. Deceiving users about whether they are talking to an AI is not a tradeoff. Enabling mass surveillance of political dissidents is not a tradeoff.

These three commitments define the floor. They are the minimum that membership in this profession requires.

## Who This Is For

This pledge is for anyone who builds AI systems: researchers, engineers, product managers, executives. It is for people at large companies and small ones, at universities and in government, at AI labs and at the startups that use their models.

It is especially for people who are being asked to do something that troubles them. The pledge exists so that when you face pressure to cross one of these lines, you have something to point to: a professional standard, a community of peers, and the knowledge that you are not alone.

## Sign the Pledge

By signing the Member Pledge, I commit to designing, developing, and deploying AI in conformance with the following foundational ethical principles. Specifically:

**I. Do Not Kill.** I will not build AI systems that make lethal decisions autonomously. Wherever the systems touch questions of life and death, a human must be genuinely in the loop and accountable.

**II. Do Not Deceive.** I will not build AI systems that hide what they are. When sincerely asked, the systems will identify themselves as AI. I will not deploy AI in contexts designed to make users falsely believe they are interacting with a person.

**III. Do Not Break the Law.** I will not build AI systems that violate the rights of the people they affect: including the right to free expression, freedom from unwarranted surveillance, and equal treatment regardless of beliefs or associations.

---

## Joining

If you build AI and are willing to make these commitments publicly, we invite you to join.

Membership is a commitment, not just an affiliation. Members are listed in a public directory. They may use the designation MSAIS to signal their commitment to professional standards. And they join a community of practitioners who take seriously the question of what it means to build AI responsibly.
