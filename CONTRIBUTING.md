## What's Welcome

**Factual corrections.** If something is wrong, fix it. Include sources.

**Better sources.** If you know a better citation for a claim, or if a link has broken, please update it.

**Sharper writing.** If something is unclear or wordy, tighten it.

**Additional resources.** If you know organizations, tools, or research that should be included, add them to the appropriate section.

**Translations.** If you can translate this into other languages, please do.

**Concrete action items.** The document tries to be actionable. If you have specific, practical suggestions for what people can do, propose them.

## What's Not Welcome

**Partisan framing.** This document is about defending constitutional democracy, not about advancing a party agenda. Keep the focus on institutions and mechanisms.

**Speculation without sources.** Claims should be documented. If you're adding new factual claims, include citations.

**Inflammatory language.** The situation is serious enough without hyperbole. Keep the tone measured and analytical.

## How to Contribute

1. **Small fixes:** Just open a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why.

2. **Larger changes:** Open an issue first to discuss the proposed change. This helps avoid wasted effort if the change doesn't fit the document's scope or approach.

3. **New sections or documents:** Definitely open an issue first. Describe what you want to add and why it belongs here.
